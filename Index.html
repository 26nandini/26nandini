        <em>hello everyone,</em><br>
        i think that everyone knows the truth about themselves.their future their past and their present but still they react that
     hey don't know anything they are very innocent <strong>lol</strong> literally what do you think! because according to me  i don't think that anyone is innocent ,just like me!<br>ya but everyone is pretending that they are very innocent and they don't know anything.<strong><em>like everyone knows about their past and its obvious but you know that where your mistake in past times and you want to correct your mistake but you can't because that's past and past never come again</em></strong><br>

        present is very confusing but if you use your brain for handle any situation then no one is smarter than you <strong><em>just like me i 'm very smart you know! (lol) </em></strong>
        now future to make your future great is in your hand and that is also depend in your present
